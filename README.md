# Working-with-Linux-Accounts-and-Password-Policies

- Ubuntu server. The security-related changes are listed below:


      Update password settings to force the minimum password length to be 12 characters, 
      
      set the minimum password age to 3 days, and set the maximum password age to 180 days.
      
      Configure the accounts to lock out after 3 failed login attempts and to lock out for 10 minutes. 
      
      Do not include the root user account in the account lockout settings.

      You've also been tasked with setting up a temporary user account called contractor1 that will expire one week from today.

      Connecting to the lab:

      Use VNC on your computer to connect to the public IP address of the instance on port 5901 (x.x.x.x:5901).
      Log in with the username and password generated by the lab. Now use the "Guide" located above the video to view the scenario and tasks to be completed.

- Set up password requirements on a Linux host:

Set the minimum password length to 12 characters:

    Run the command sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password.
    
    At the end of the first uncommented line (line 25) add minlen=12, one space after sha512.
    
    Save the file and exit nano.

Set the maximum password age to 180 days and the minimum password age to 3 days:

    Run the command sudo nano /etc/login.defs.
    
    Search for 99999 (press Ctrl + W to search).
    
    Replace 99999 with 180.
    
    On the next line down, replace the 0 with 3.
    
    Save the file and exit nano.
